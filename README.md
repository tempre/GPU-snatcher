## About

This simple bot won't guarnetee you a new 30 series card, but hopefully it will help.

## Notice

On a note please be wary of the traffic you are sending to newegg as you could risk ban for automation. During my test I was able to achieve around 12 hours without any issues.

## Installation

To get this bad boy going you're going to need [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html).

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Usage

Within the config type your NewEgg username and password along with the respected 30 series graphics card you are searching for.
